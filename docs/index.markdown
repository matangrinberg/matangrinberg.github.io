# About

I am a PhD student at the Berkeley Center for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Berkeley. I work with Dr. Benjamin Nachman at Berkeley Lab and am interested in machine learning applications to high-energy physics, theoretical machine learning and quantum computing. Previously I studied string theory and quantum gravity at the University of Cambridge (Part III) and Princeton University (undergraduate).
