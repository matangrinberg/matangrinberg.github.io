## The Road Not Taken
_By Robert Frost_

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

## Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night
_By Dylan Thomas_

Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

## A Dream Within a Dream
_By Edgar Allan Poe_

Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow â€”
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.
